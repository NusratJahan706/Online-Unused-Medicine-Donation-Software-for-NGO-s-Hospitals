## Project Life Cycle
The waterfall model is a classical model used in system development life cycle to create a system with a linear and sequential approach. It is termed as waterfall because the model develops systematically from one phase to another in downward fashion. The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement. The waterfall approach is the earliest approach that was used for software development. Here the phases do not overlap with each other. The different sequential phases of the classical waterfall model are shown in the below figure:
